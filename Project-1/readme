Jenkins-

Install Plugins: Install the following plugins in Jenkins:
Pipeline: Allows defining the pipeline as code using a Jenkinsfile.
Docker Pipeline: Integrates Docker with Jenkins pipelines.
AWS CLI: Integrates Jenkins with AWS services via CLI commands.
Amazon ECR Plugin (if you're using ECR for Docker registry).
AWS Credentials Plugin: To securely store AWS credentials in Jenkins.

Explanation:

Build Stage: Builds the Docker image for your Java application.
Test Stage: Runs tests for the Java application.
Deploy Stage: Deploys the application using AWS SAM to your AWS environment.
Make sure to replace placeholders like your-image-name, your-stack-name, your-s3-bucket, your-aws-region, and your-aws-account-id with your actual values.

Also, ensure that Jenkins has appropriate permissions to interact with AWS services, either by using IAM roles or by providing AWS credentials securely through Jenkins credentials plugin.

This Jenkinsfile can be version-controlled along with your application code, providing a consistent and reproducible CI/CD pipeline.
